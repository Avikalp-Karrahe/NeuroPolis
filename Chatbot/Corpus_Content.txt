Explain how disaster risk levels are determined?
Disaster risk levels are categorized by evaluating wind speed, precipitation, severity, and casualties. The risk scoring is as follows:

High Risk: Wind speed > 85 km/h or precipitation > 175 mm, combined with either severity ≥ 8.0 or casualties ≥ 85.

Low Risk: Wind speed < 70 km/h or precipitation < 120 mm, combined with severity ≤ 6.0 and casualties ≤ 60.

Medium Risk: Events that do not clearly meet either the high or low-risk criteria are classified as medium risk.

Q2: What do marker colors indicate on the dashboard map?
Marker colors indicate the disaster risk level


Green markers: Low risk.

Orange markers: Medium risk.

Dark Red markers: High risk.

Q3: What information is displayed when clicking a disaster marker?
A3: Clicking a marker reveals detailed information including:

Disaster type

Zone number

Risk level

Wind speed

Precipitation

Severity

Casualty count

Q4: How is the disaster events map centered, and what is shown?
A4: The map is centered based on the average latitude and longitude of all disaster events. Markers are grouped using MarkerCluster to maintain clarity, especially in densely populated disaster areas.

Explanatory Note:
This dashboard aids in crisis management for smart city scenarios, helping city officials quickly interpret disaster data and allocate resources effectively during emergencies.
