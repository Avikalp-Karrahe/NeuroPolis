## 🧠 Executive Summary

NeuroPolis is an AI-powered crisis intelligence platform built to give cities clarity, coordination, and control during compound disasters. It transforms fragmented data (sensors, tweets, hospital records) into predictive models, misinformation detection, and real-time action plans.

## 🗂️ Slide-by-Slide Highlights

**Slide 1 – Title**  
🧠 Branding and mission: turning signals into strategy for smart cities during crises.

**Slide 2 – The Problem**  
📉 One event triggers another (e.g., flood → power outage → hospital crisis). Data exists but is fragmented. Fake news makes it worse. Cities need decision systems, not just alerts.

**Slide 3 – Our Solution**  
🔧 Four key functions:  
- Cascade Disaster Prediction  
- Misinformation Detection  
- Live Risk Visualization  
- GPT-4-Powered Recommendation Engine

**Slide 4 – Our Approach**  
🧪 Project workflow includes EDA, preprocessing, blockchain, and modeling. Used Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.  

**Slide 5 – How It Works**  
🚨 Uses sensor and tweet signals with severity scores to trigger actions like:  
- Evacuate if flood > 75%  
- Reroute if road < 30%  
- Switch hospitals if occupancy > 90%

**Slide 6 – Innovation Highlight**  
✨ Blockchain-based trust ledger + real-time pattern recognition = explainable and auditable crisis AI

**Slide 7 – Visual Samples**  
🖥️ Chatbot + blockchain ledger + dashboards and model comparisons

**Slide 8 – Impact Metrics**  
📊 Hurricane Ian simulation:  
- 70% fatality reduction  
- $11B economic losses saved  
- 60% emergency asset efficiency boost

**Slide 9 – Simulation Results**  
📌 Based on modeled Hurricane Ian data. Validates NeuroPolis' decision logic and risk reductions.

**Slide 10 – Team**  
👥 Avikalp, Rachel, CK, Adeyemi — interdisciplinary power squad (MSBA + MBA)

**Slide 11 – Appendix Index**  
📚 Lists the 8 core modules: prediction model, tweet classifier, risk dashboard, GPT planner, blockchain audit system, chatbot, and tech stack.

**Slide 12 – Documentation**  
📎 Includes links to Colab notebooks, docs, and simulations.

**Slide 13 – Related Research**  
🧠 Literature + tool stack (Preswald, FloodNet, Pandas, Hyperledger)

**Slide 14 – Data Exploration: Severity & Weather**  
☔ Distributions of disaster severity and weather metrics; confirms clean and unbiased inputs

**Slide 15 – Model Performance**  
🔥 Feature importance + perfect classification on synthetic data

**Slide 16 – Interactive Risk Maps**  
🗺️ Zone classification map with consistent sensor scores across regions
